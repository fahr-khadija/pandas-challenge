# Pandas-Challenge
create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data

# Background
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.
# Results 

### The result is in the file attached  "PyCitySchools_starter-good"
### The report of data analysis is in the file attached  "Report_finale"
### The picture result of the code is in the folder  attached  "Image"

# District Summary
Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.

# Scores by School Spending

## Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).
### Use the code provided below to create four bins with reasonable cutoff values to group school spending.
```
# Establish the bins pd.cut
spending_bins = [0, 585, 630, 645, 680]

labels = ["<$585", "$585-630", "$630-645", "$645-680"]
```
# Create a copy of the school summary since it has the "Per Student Budget" 
```
school_spending_df = per_school_summary.copy()
```
### Use pd.cut to categorize spending based on the bins.
```
# Establish the bins and labels
spening_bins = [0, 585, 630, 645, 680]
labels = ["<$585", "$585-630", "$630-645", "$645-680"]
# Use pd.cut() to categorize spending based on the bins
school_spending_df["Spending Ranges (Per Student)"] = pd.cut(
    school_spending_df["Per Student Budget"],
    bins=spending_bins,
    labels=labels
)
```
### Use the following code to then calculate mean scores per spending range.
```
spending_math_scores = school_spending_df.groupby(["Spending Ranges (Per Student)"])["Average Math Score"].mean()
spending_reading_scores = school_spending_df.groupby(["Spending Ranges (Per Student)"])["Average Reading Score"].mean()
spending_passing_math = school_spending_df.groupby(["Spending Ranges (Per Student)"])["% Passing Math"].mean()
spending_passing_reading = school_spending_df.groupby(["Spending Ranges (Per Student)"])["% Passing Reading"].mean()
overall_passing_spending = school_spending_df.groupby(["Spending Ranges (Per Student)"])["% Overall Passing"].mean()
Use the scores above to create a DataFrame called spending_summary.
```
-![image](https://github.com/fahr-khadija/pandas-challenge/blob/main/Images/spending_range(per%20Student)_sammury.jpg)

### Include the following metrics in the table:
Average math score,Average reading score,% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math),% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading),% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading),Scores by School Size


### Use the following code to bin the per_school_summary.

size_bins = [0, 1000, 2000, 5000]
labels = ["Small (<1000)", "Medium (1000-2000)", "Large (2000-5000)"]
### Use pd.cut on the "Total Students" column of the per_school_summary DataFrame.
```
# Establish the bins and labels
spening_bins = [0, 585, 630, 645, 680]
labels = ["<$585", "$585-630", "$630-645", "$645-680"]
# Use pd.cut() to categorize spending based on the bins
school_spending_df["Spending Ranges (Per Student)"] = pd.cut(
    school_spending_df["Per Student Budget"],
    bins=spending_bins,
    labels=labels
)
```
#  Calculate averages for the desired columns. 
```
# Group the per_school_summary DataFrame by "School Type" and average the results.
average_math_score_by_type = per_school_summary.groupby("School Type")["Average Math Score"].mean()
average_reading_score_by_type = per_school_summary.groupby("School Type")["Average Reading Score"].mean()
average_percent_passing_math_by_type = per_school_summary.groupby("School Type")["% Passing Math"].mean()
average_percent_passing_reading_by_type = per_school_summary.groupby("School Type")["% Passing Reading"].mean()
average_percent_overall_passing_by_type = per_school_summary.groupby("School Type")["% Overall Passing"].mean()

```
## Create a DataFrame called size_summary that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).
```
# Assemble the new data by type into a DataFrame called `type_summary`
type_summary =pd.DataFrame({
    "Average Math Score": average_math_score_by_type,
    "Average Reading Score": average_reading_score_by_type,
    "% Passing Math": average_percent_passing_math_by_type,
    "% Passing Reading": average_percent_passing_reading_by_type,
    "% Overall Passing": average_percent_overall_passing_by_type
